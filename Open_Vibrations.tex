\section*{Preface}
This open-source text is designed to offer the reader a complete text on the basics of mechanical vibrations. 

\subsection*{Cover Art}
The B-57 Canberra is an American-built copy of the British English Electric Canberra which first flew in 1949. During initial high-speed flight testing, excessive vibrations were measured on the canopy and a small fairing was added behind the canopy to reduce the aerodynamic load on the canopy and thereby reduce the vibrations. Overall, airframes flight testing is said to have gone very smoothly. 

The B-57 was initially a twin-engined tactical bomber and reconnaissance aircraft but over the years, various versions were produced or modified from the original stock. These include the WB-57F, a specialized strategic reconnaissance version developed for the U.S. Air Force that is still flown by NASA for scientific missions. Of note, in 2011 NASA determined that they needed a third WB-57F to support their mission and an additional WB-57 (s/n 63-13298) was removed from the Air Forces Boneyard in Tucson Arizona after 40 years of storage and returned to operational status. As of 2022, three airframes are still flying for NASA.

The airframe on the cover is the SN 52-1516 and is an EB-57B ``Night Intruder'' which is an electronic countermeasure (ECM) version of the B-57 and is on static display at the Air Force Armament Museum at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.

% Notes on compiling Document
%
% 1. Each chapter can be compiled on there own.
% 2. I set the document up with a common figures folder to allow for the reuse of figures and generally to keep the document clean. 
% 3. When compiling the main document, you must include the \graphicspath{{xx}} for the first chapter, to set it in chapter 1. From here on, it will think its in the chapter one folder but the <../figures> in each folder will work with this. 
% 4. I (Austin Downey) have gotten this to compile on Windows with MikTeX and Linux with TeXLive. Your results may vary. For Linux, I:
% 	i.	added the extra {} in \graphicspath
% 	ii.	removed the .tex extension from the file names except for chapter 1. 
% 5. The common bibliography is an issue that has yet to be sorted out.
